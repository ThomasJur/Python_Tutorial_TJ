    "\n",
    "**Firstly**, I would like to demonstrate why and how some basic programming knowledge can be useful for the daily work of historians, social scientists, people working in the field of religious studies, philologists, and others who are dealing with (preferably already digitized) textual data. Therefore, **I have manually created a simple use case in the form of two different text versions of the same text that we want to compare to each other using Python.** More precisely, our task in this tutorial is\n",
    "\n",
    " - _to load the two text versions and make them accessible in Python (**data loading and cleaning**)_\n",
    " - _to compare both text versions with each other and to highlight the differences (**data processing**)_\n",
    " - _to create, output, and save one single file that merges the two different text versions and informs us about the differences between them (**data storing**)_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondly**, I will introduce some basic concepts of (high level) programming languages such as Python. For instance, in the course of this tutorial we will deal with\n",
    "\n",
    " - **variables**\n",
    " - _different basic built-in datatypes such as_ **strings**, **integers**, _and_ **floats**\n",
    " - _**lists**_\n",
    " - _**functions**_ (even though we won't create functions, we will still use them)\n",

    "## Part One: Loading Textual Data into Python\n",
    "Before we can start working with the two text versions, we first have to make them accessible in Python. This means that we have to load them into the Python environment.

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Ok, what you should see now is the beginning of Kafka's \"The Trial\" below the cell that you have just executed. But what exactly did we do here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"text_a.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "What we basically did here is using a built-in Python **function** `open()` to open a text file. You can usually identify functions in code through the `()` behind their name (for instance, `open()` `close()` `len()` etc. are all built-in Python functions that perform different operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, **what is a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in programming can be compared to functions in mathematics. Functions take a certain input, do something with this input, and then (usually) create an output. For instance, the function $ f(x) =\\ x^2 $ takes, let's say, any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$  as an input and outputs the square of it. The `open()` function operates in exactly the same way. It takes a certain input (that is called \"argument\" in the case of functions in programming), does some magic with it \"behind the scenes\", and outputs something (else). In our case, we are passing two arguments to the function. First, we pass the name of the file to the function that we want to open as a **string** object: `\"text_a.txt\"`. A **string** object is one of the fundamental data types in Python and can basically be interpreted as text. In order to tell Python that we want to create an object of the type string, we have to wrap the data in quotation marks `\"\"` (otherwise, it won't work and Python will throw an error). We will talk about some other important data types in a second, but let's first get back to our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument that we pass to the function `open()` is `\"r\"` which stands for \"read\" and is also of type string. This argument tells Python that we do only want to read from `text_a.txt` (and not write something into the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then assign the output of the `open()` function (which is a file object that we can now further process in Python) to a **variable** named `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is a **variable** and why do we need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a variable is a container that we can use to store data. In this case, we are storing the output of `open()` in a container (**variable**) called `f`. This comes in handy as we want to further process the file object that we have just created with `open()`. Instead of calling the function `open()` over and over again whenever we want to do something with the textual data from `text_a.txt`, we can simply store the output content of `open()` (a file object) in `f`. From now on, we can take this variable `f` whenever we want to access the textual data from `text_a.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red>There are two important things to note here</font>: Firstly, variables in Python underly certain restrictions (for instance, a variable cannot start with a number; for example, `123four` does not work as a variable name in Python), but generally you are free to name them however you like. For instance, instead of calling our variable `f`, we could also call it `file` or `Darth_Vader` or `FRUCHTTIGER`. Note, however, that Python is **case sensitive** (thus, `file` and `FILE` are different names in Python) and that there exist some naming conventions in Python that are beyond the scope of this tutorial. For further reading, I recommend the Wikipedia entry on __[Naming Conventions (programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, so much text for only one line of code! Note, however, that these are the basics that we will encounter over and over again. Once you have understood them, we will be able to go through our code much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly look at the second line of our code where we use some of the concepts that we've already discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text_a = f.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we would try and read our file `f` right now (for instance, by passing it to our standard output via the built-in Python function `print()` in the third line of our code), we would encounter something like `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='text_a.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>`. This, of course, is not what we want. Before we can access our real text data, we first have to process our file object stored in `f` a little further. We are doing this via the **method** `read()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hold on... why is this a **method** and not a **function**?! For the sake of simplicity, we will leave this problem aside in this tutorial and agree that _**methods**, for us, work in pretty the same way as **functions**_. However, methods are always connected to an object (which is `f` in this case) which is expressed via the `.` in this example. For further reading, please see [footnote 1](#footnote1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after we've processed our file `f` via the `read()` method and stored the output (which is of type **string**) in another variable (that we named `text_a`), we can finally print out the text that was stored in the file `text_a.txt` and is now available in our Python environment for further processing!\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Task:\n",
    "After such a long reading, it's now time for some practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, the goal of this chapter is to compare two different versions of one text. So far, we have only loaded one text. What about you try and load our `text_b.txt` file in the cell below?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start doing this, be aware that variables can only contain one value at the same time. Thus, if you would try and load our second text into the variable called `text_a`, you would overwrite the former content of `text_a` with the new content from `text_b.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, why don't you try out some other built-in functions of Python? For instance, you could use the built-in Python function `type()` with one of our loaded text files as an **argument** (for instance, with `text_a`) to display the data type of the file (which, in this case, should be of type `string`). You could also go and see what length (which is the number of characters and spaces) our `text_a` file in Python has by using the built-in Python function `len()` and again the text file `text_a` as an argument. Note that you should get used to printing out the outputs of functions like `len()` or `type()`, although in Jupyter notebooks it would even work without the `print()` statement. So, instead of writing `len(x)` you should try and always write `print(len(x))`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    " - load the second text file `text_b.txt` (in a readable form!) into Python and assign it to an appropriate variable of your choice\n",
    " - play around with other built-in Python functions such as `type()` or `len()` by passing the already loaded text files as an argument\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can execute the code in the code cells by pressing `SHIFT + ENTER`.\n"

    " - `==` (equal to)\n",
    " - `<` or `>` (smaller or bigger than)\n",
    " - logical operators such as `and` or `or`\n",
    " - and many more (for an overview, see the official Python 3 documentation under this __[link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)__)\n",
    " \n",
    "What these operators do is to compare two (or more) arguments to each other and return either the value `True` (which is sometimes represented as 1) or `False` (which can also be represented as 0) as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why don't you try and compare the two text files to each other via the `==` operator in the cell below? What is the output? Note that you can also store the output in a variable which you could then print out via the `print()` command as in the following code example:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    "ident_txt = (text_a == text_b) # note that we do not need the () here, but they make the code more readable\n",
    "print(ident_txt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Additional task_: What about the lengths of the two texts? Store the output of the `len()` function (which is of type `int` meaning `integer`) of the two texts in two different variables, then create a third variable that takes the Boolean value of the comparison of the two variables and print it out. What happens if you try to compare `text_a` of type `string` to `len(text_a)` (which is of type `int`)?\n",

Great, but... our string does not only use `.` for the end of a sentence but for abbreviations such as `Mrs.` or `K.` as well. What can we do to solve this problem?\n",
    " - Secondly, we can see that we have at least one empty string in our list (the last one; this is also the reason why our command `print(text_a_sentences[-1])` didn't print anything - because the last entry in our list was simply empty!)\n",
    " - Thirdly, you might have noticed that some of the strings that are the start of a sentence have a space `__` as a first character; for the moment, this only looks weird but does not really bother us; however, this might become a problem later on so we should take care of this as soon as possible.\n",
    " \n",
    "I have to admit that this result is quite disappointing. You might even ask yourself: Why would you create a tutorial with something like this?!\n",

    "Well, because you will encounter problems like this _over and over and over_ again. Preparing and cleaning your data for the actual analysis is a major part when dealing with textual data and you will for sure encounter problems like this all the time. Annoyingly, dealing with these kinds of problems can quickly become really messy and difficult, depending on both your data and the things you want to do with it. But don't worry, in most cases you will find a solution (at some point) and there are many built-in functions in Python (as well as external libraries that you can load in your poject) that will make your life much easier (see [footnote 2](#footnote2) for some suggestions). However, as this is a tutorial we will not use external libraries to solve our problems but try to cope with them with only the things we know."

   "source": [
    "Let's start about thinking of solutions for our first problem. How can we tell Python to only split the sentences after the sentence is actually finished? Well, there are several more or less clumsy ways of doing this. We will go for a pretty clumsy one that, however, allows us to introduce another built-in string method, namely `str.replace()`! This method takes two arguments of type `string`. But first, you need to put the string that you want to be changed at the start of the method (thus acting as the object from which we call the `replace()` method which is a method from Python's built in `string` class [footnote 3](#footnote3)). The two arguments we pass are: First, the string that we want to be changed and second a string of how we want it to be changed. For example, let's say that we have the string `\"I am four meters tall!\"` stored in a variable called `height`. This is obviously not true, so we want to change the `\"four\"` to `\"two\"` (which isn't true either, by the way). We can easily do that by using our `str.replace()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "height = \"I am four meters tall!\"\n",
    "new_string = height.replace(\"four\", \"two\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "If you want, you can copy & paste this code in one of the code cells below to execute it. The output should be `\"I am two meters tall!\"`\n",

But what about the initial spaces at the beginning of some of the sentences? If we would try to delete them with our `str.replace()` method, we would obviously delete _every_ space in the string – which is something that we, of course, do not want to do. Luckily, Python again provides us with an appropriate built-in method called `strip()`. `strip()` deletes every space at the beginning and at the end of a string (together with some other expressions such as `\\n` that are in most cases irrelevant for the actual single string).\n",

    "Again, let's break this down into several parts and start with the first line `for number in range(0,len(text_a_list))`. This might look a little confusing at first, however, the logic behind it is quite simple. But first, we have to understand **how a for loop works.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **for loop** basically consists of two parts and you can best understand it by literally reading it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "`FOR (every) number IN (the) range from 0 to len(text_a_list) DO something`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know that `len(text_a_list) = 4 = len(text_b_list)`, this also reads as\n",
    "\n",
    "`FOR (every) number IN (the) range from 0 to 4 DO something`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what are we doing in this case? We are taking the single numbers of each loop to use them as indices for our lists and compare the list elements to each other (note that the numbers we receive from `range()` are 0,1,2,3, because the `range(0,X)` function is inclusive for the first element (0) but not for the second one (X). Thus, `range(0,10)` means \"0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\" - this is very annoying in the beginning, I agree, but you will get used to it quickly. You can learn more about for loops in the link that I have provided above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are struggling with this right now, just accept it. It takes some time to understand all this. You don't learn a language in one day and neither do you learn programming in a day or even in one tutorial. It's important that you know that these concepts exist and that you use them to become familiar with them. And be assured, you will use for loops (as well as other loops) _everywhere_, because they are so powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you look at the output, you can see a column of `FALSE` `FALSE` `TRUE` `FALSE`. This means that all sentences except the third one differ from the sentences in the other version. This is already quite an insight! Before we proceed and see how we can figure out what the exact differences are all about, let's quickly come back to the for loop again. It is important to understand how loops in general and for loops in particular work. A loop performs exactly like you would expect it to work when you hear that it is called \"loop\":\n",
    "\n",
    "The code starts with the first number from our `range(len(text_a_list))` container, assigns the value from the container to the variable `number` (which is then `= 0`), and then goes through the indented instructions behind the `:`. To read more about the fundamental concept of `indentation` in Python, please follow __[this link](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_blocks.php)__. This means that during the first loop, the instructions would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "similarity = (text_a_list[0] == text_b_list[0]) # because the variable number has the value 0 right now\n",
    "print(similarity)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the result is printed out, the loop **returns to its beginning (the `for`)**. But this time, the second element from the `range(len(text_a_list))` iterable container is assigned to `number` (which is then `= 1`). The loop then again proceeds towards the Boolean comparison, prints out the result of the comparison between `text_a_list[1]` and `text_b_list[1]`, and again returns to the starting point of the for loop. It continues like this until the container with iterable elements (here, the `range(len(text_a_list))` function) is \"empty\". Then, the loop ends and Python continues with the code that follows after the for loop with its indented statements."

    "### If-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing I want to introduce in this tutorial is an **if-statement**. If-statements are great to structure the flow of our program. Again, it might be the easiest way to understand if-statements by using \"pseudo code\" (which is more readable than actual code -  although certain people would even call Python \"pseudo code\" due to its readability, \"magic behind the scenes\", and... ah, we don't care).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does an if-statement do? Well, it acts as kind of a doorkeeper by setting up certain conditions that have to be evaluated as `TRUE` in order to execute the indented code that follows the if-statement. For instance, look at the following \"code\":\n",
    "\n",
    "`IF i am younger than twelve THEN i only have to pay 1€ for a bus ticket\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, more abstractly, could be read as\n",
    "\n",
    "`IF myAge <= 12 THEN ticketPrice = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "busTicket = 15 # yes, it's very expensive!\n",
    "myAge = 13\n",
    "if myAge <= 12:\n",
    "    busTicket = 1\n",
    "print(busTicket)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "What would the output in this case look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think you got the general point of if-statements and conditional statements in programming languages such as Python: We first have to fullfil a certain condition and if this condition is met (and therefore results in a Boolean `TRUE`), the following indented statement(s) below the if-statement will be executed. If the condition results in a `FALSE`, the indented code after the statement will be skipped and Python continues with the code after the if-statement. However, there is always more to learn. For instance, you can combine one dimensional if-statements with further conditions (`elif` which is short for `else if` and `else`). Or you could create a more complex condition that includes several lower level conditions. See, for example, the code below (what does it do? What is the value of the output?):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "busTicket = 0\n",
    "myAge = 15\n",
    "if myAge <= 12:\n",
    "    busTicket = 1\n",
    "elif (myAge > 12) and (myAge <= 18):\n",
    "    busTicket = 5\n",
    "else:\n",

This tokenizer can deal with all the problems above and will return a nicely split string as a list. If you want, you can copy & paste the code below into a code cell and execute it to see the result (note again that you have to have NLTK installed).</div>\n",
