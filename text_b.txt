Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had dne nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breekfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pilloow at the old woman who lived oposite and who was watching him with an inquiseness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell.
